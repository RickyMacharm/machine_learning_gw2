This repo decide which features are helpful in predicting the target variable for time series data â€“serial correlation, momentum, technical analysis indicators (such as RSI), and signals from trend-following strategies (such as the moving average crossover)

Further it includes - 

1.	Selecting at least four explanatory variables and perform the necessary transformations so that they are useful in the model phase. 

2.	Details about each technique investigated and a step by step implementation of it in a Jupyter Notebook.
